## Prometheus supports exporting metrics for things like cronjobs to a specific location on disk, where the node
## exporter will later pick them up. The path below is the the location the metrics are expected to appear, in the
## prometheus format.
##
## It is created with liberal permissions, so any process can export metrics to it.
